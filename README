This is a fork of the Univa Grid Engine project hosted on GITHUB
https://github.com/gridengine/gridengine
====================================================================

We would like to introduce the following set of new features to the current 
Grid Engine project.

* Integration of GPUs, FPGAs, MICs, etc.
* Accounting & scaling factors of GPUs, FPGAs, MICs, etc.
* Monitoring web interface (PHPQstat)
* Efficiency Control (Green Scheduler)
* Dynamic Resource Quota
* Simplify Topology-Aware Scheduling
* Review confusing ticket number parameter 
* Include on qstat a realtime fairshare priority view.
* New queue_sort_method : fill_node (to extend the current sort methods load & seq_no).

Please, send us feedback and suggest us new features to develop.

Thanks!
